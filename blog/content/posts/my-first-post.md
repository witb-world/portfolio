## Welcome to my blog!

This is a space where I will share some writeups of hacking projects I've done. I have been going through exercises on platforms including [Hack the Box](https://hackthebox.eu), [Vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org) and more.

This site is also an exercise in cloud hosting and cloud-native technologies. The blog is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), while the rest of the site is a smattering of my own HTML and CSS coding. It is currently hosted as a static site in an AWS S3 bucket. I am also currently studying for the Microsoft Azure AZ-900 certification.

More to come soon!
